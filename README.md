# Real-Time-Bus_Tracker

This is a "Real Time" location of a random public bus in Boston, Massachusetts.



I used MBTA's API to get the real time location of the public bus and also the Mapbox API for the map.



Installation
Download the Zip file on this link to get the files for the Real Time Bus Tracker Exercise.

Roadmap
In the future, this will not just be a single random bus, but it will be turned into an app for transportation to help the people that commutes.
