# Real-Time-Bus_Tracker

This is a "Real Time" location of a random public bus in Boston, Massachusetts.

I used MBTA's API to get the real time location of the public bus and also the Mapbox API for the map.

Roadmap
In the future, this will not just be a single random bus, but it will be turned into an app for transportation to help the people that commutes.
